# Real-Time-Decision-Support-System-In-Agriculture

This project focuses on developing a **Real-Time Decision Support System** to enhance agricultural productivity by integrating **IoT sensors** and **cloud-based analytics**. The system provides actionable insights to farmers for improving crop yield and optimizing resource utilization.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Collects data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and crop health using IoT sensors.
- **Cloud Integration**: Sends sensor data to a cloud platform for storage and processing.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizes machine learning models for decision-making, including irrigation scheduling, pest control, and fertilizer application.
- **Alerts and Dashboards**: Provides real-time alerts and a user-friendly dashboard for data visualization and trend analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Hardware**: Microcontroller-based sensors, IoT devices.
- **Software and Platforms**: Python, Arduino IDE, ThingSpeak.
- **Frameworks**: IoT protocols for data collection and machine learning for predictive analytics.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Assemble the IoT sensor network for soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
   - Connect sensors to a microcontroller and configure communication modules (e.g., Wi-Fi or LoRa).

2. **Software Requirements**:
   - Install Python and required libraries for machine learning and data processing.
   - Set up Arduino IDE for programming the microcontroller.
   - Configure ThingSpeak for cloud data storage and visualization.

3. **Running the System**:
   - Deploy the IoT sensors in the field and power the hardware.
   - Run the data collection and processing scripts to integrate the system.
   - Access the dashboard for real-time insights and decision support.

## Use Cases
- **Irrigation Management**: Optimize water usage by monitoring soil moisture and predicting irrigation schedules.
- **Threshold Soil moisture Level calculation**: Receive alerts based on decrease in soil moisture level below the threshold moisture level.

## Results and Impact
- Improved crop yield by providing data-driven recommendations.
- Reduced resource wastage through optimized irrigation.
- Delivered a scalable and cost-effective solution for small and large-scale farmers.

## Future Improvements
- **Scalability**: Extend the system for large-scale deployments.
- **AI Integration**: Enhance decision-making models using advanced AI techniques.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile app for easier access to alerts and dashboards.
